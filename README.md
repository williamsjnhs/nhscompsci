### January 31 - Blackjack
Write a function to play Blackjack.  This function takes: 
- a character vector representing the player's hand
- a character representing the face-up card of the dealer 
- a character vector of other cards face-up on the table 

The function returns a boolean where `true` represents a "hit" and `false` represents a "stand". 

Below is a template for this function which will always "stand":
```c++
bool play(vector <char> hand, char dealer, vector <char> other_cards) {
  return false; 
}
```

#### Workflow: 
1. Go to https://github.com/williamsjnhs/blackjack and fork the project by clicking `fork` in the top right. This creates a new copy of the `blackjack` project in your repositories.  

2. In Replit, import your new blackjack repository and complete your code!

3. Commit your working code. Once committed, your code it should be viewable at:

https://raw.githubusercontent.com/[your_username]/blackjack/main/main.cpp

where [your_username] is your Github username.
