### January 31 - Blackjack
Write a function to play Blackjack.  This function takes: 
- a character vector representing the player's hand
- a character representing the face-up card of the dealer 
- a character vector of other cards face-up on the table 

The function returns a boolean where `true` represents a "hit" and `false` represents a "stay". 

Below is a template for this function which will always "stay":
```c++
bool play(vector <char> hand, char dealer, vector <char> other_cards) {
  return false; 
}
```

In the `blackjack` folder of this repository, you will find code which you can use to test your function.  

#### Submission: 
Create a Github repository named `NHScsQ3`.  In this repository, create a folder named `blackjack`.  In your `blackjack` folder, put your `play` function in a file named `main.cpp`

If done correctly, after you commit your code it should be viewable at:

https://raw.githubusercontent.com/[your_username]/NHScsQ3/main/blackjack/main.cpp

where [your_username] is your Github username.
